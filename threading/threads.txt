ğŸ§±Basic Python Needed Before Threading

ğŸ‘‰ How to create a function:

```
def greet():
    print("Hello")

greet()  # Output: Hello

```
ğŸ‘‰ How to use loops:

```
for i in range(3):
    print(i)

```

Now weâ€™ll use these basics in Threading :

STEP 2: Create your first Thread
ğŸ”¸ Without Threading (runs one after another):

```
def task1():
    for i in range(3):
        print("Task 1")

def task2():
    for i in range(3):
        print("Task 2")

task1()
task2()

```


ğŸ”¸ With Threading (runs at the same time)

```
import threading

def task1():
    for i in range(3):
        print("Task 1")

def task2():
    for i in range(3):
        print("Task 2")

t1 = threading.Thread(target=task1)
t2 = threading.Thread(target=task2)

t1.start()  # Starts task1 in new thread
t2.start()  # Starts task2 in new thread

t1.join()   # Waits for task1 to finish
t2.join()   # Waits for task2 to finish

print("Both tasks finished")

```
