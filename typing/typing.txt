Python is dynamically typed, so it does not require declaring types.

But using typing module helps to:
    - Write clean, safe, and readable code
    - Get IDE suggestions and catch type errors earlier
    - Make your functions understandable for others and AI models

1. Type Hinting in Functions
ðŸ”¹ Without Typing
```
def add(a, b):
    return a + b

```

Works, but IDE doesn't know if a, b are int, float, or str

ðŸ”¹ With Typing:

```
def add(a: int, b: int) -> int:
    return a + b

```    
a: int â†’ parameter type
-> int â†’ return type


ðŸ”¹Typing for Variables
```
name: str = "Jhanani"
age: int = 21
height: float = 5.4
active: bool = True

```
This is just optional, but helps during development
